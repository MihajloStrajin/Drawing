# Drawing

Desktop application in Java
#
This is simple app for drawing shapes. User can draw points, lines, circles, rectangles, donuts and hexagons. Shapes can be modified and deleted. User can modify one shape and can delete more than one shape. There are undo and redo options if user make a mistake. User can save drawing and log that is written down. When user load log, shapes can be loaded one by one by clicking the button LOAD. I used some design patterns in this app. Design patterns I used are MVC, Command, Adapter, Observer, Prototype and Strategy.
